I’m a full-stack developer from Norway, currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

My professional career has focused primarily on backend development, data engineering and, more recently, AI engineering. I co-founded the fintech company Harvest Funds and the climate tech company Zerolytics. Visit my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vegardegeland/) for details.
