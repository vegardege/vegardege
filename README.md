I’m a full-stack developer from Norway, currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

My professional career has focused primarily on backend development, data engineering and, more recently, AI engineering. I co-founded the fintech company Harvest Funds and the climate tech company Zerolytics. Visit my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vegardegeland/) for details about my professional life.

In my spare time, I like to create little web apps and libraries. Some of my live sites:

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎹 **[Diatonic](https://diatonic.pebblepatch.dev/)** | Interactive music theory web application |
| ⚡️ **[How Much Energy?](https://energy.pebblepatch.dev/)** | Energy and power quantity contextualizer |
| 📖 **[Book Bear](https://bookbear.pebblepatch.dev/)** | Find the most popular works of an author |
| 🇩🇰 **[The King's Speech](https://kingsspeech.pebblepatch.dev/en)** | Statistical analysis of the Danish monarch's NYE speeches |
| 🌾 **[Pebble Patch](https://pebblepatch.dev)** | Overview of libraries and smaller projects |

In addition to the web sites, I have open source libraries published to PyPI, crates.io, and NPM.

All projects are MIT licensed, so feel free to fork or contribute!
