Iâ€™m a full-stack developer from Norway, currently based in Copenhagen,
Denmark.

My professional career has focused primarily on backend development, data
engineering and, more recently, AI engineering. I co-founded the fintech
company Harvest Funds and the climate tech company Zerolytics. Visit my
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vegardegeland/) for details.

This profile is used to share my hobby projects, shared in the spirit of
sharing. Examples of live projects:

* [Diatonic](https://diatonic.pebblepatch.dev/)
* [Book Bear](https://bookbear.pebblepatch.dev/)

I have packages published to PyPI, crates.io, and NPM. I don't make any
guarantees about maintenance, as these are hobby projects, but feedback
or feature requests are welcome. All projects are MIT licensed, so feel
free to fork or contribute!

When possible, I make projects available on
[Pebble Patch](https://pebblepatch.dev).
