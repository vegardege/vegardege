I’m a full-stack developer from Norway, currently based in Copenhagen,
Denmark.

My professional career has focused primarily on data engineering and, more
recently, AI engineering. I’ve co-founded Harvest Funds and Zerolytics,
alongside consultancy work and full-time roles. Visit my
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vegardegeland/) for details.

This profile is where I share smaller weekend projects in the spirit of sharing 
and collaboration. All projects are MIT licensed, but I generally do not
actively distribute them, and most will not be actively maintained after
the initial release.

For examples of what I like to built in my spare time, check out
[Diatonic](https://diatonic.pebblepatch.dev) or
[BookBear](https://bookbear.pebblepatch.dev).

When possible, I make projects available on 
[Pebble Patch](https://pebblepatch.dev).
